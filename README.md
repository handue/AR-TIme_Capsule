## üì± Project Overview

AR Time Capsule is a platform where users can record and share memories at specific locations. Users can create time capsules (posts) at specific locations, and other users can view these time capsules through AR when they visit the location. Content can also be shared exclusively within specific groups through the party system.

Modern people live reminiscing about the past. In today's society, where it's common to post memorable photos and writings on individual SNS platforms, we've created a new concept of SNS that focuses on vivid experiences and places that hold special memories for people.

AR Time Capsule allows users to vividly experience past memories through AR technology, which is difficult to feel through simple photos or videos. By providing AR content tailored to the user's current location, it enhances immersion and facilitates experience sharing and communication between users.

### Screenshot Descriptions

1. **AR Camera View**: This screenshot shows the actual AR camera view where capsule-shaped AR objects dynamically move in the environment. Each capsule displays its title above it. Users can only see these capsules when they visit the actual location where the capsule was saved. By clicking on a capsule, users can view the photos and content inside.

2. **Map View**: The map page allows users to see the real-time locations of their time capsules. The color coding of the capsules indicates whether they were posted by the user themselves or by someone they follow, making it easy to distinguish between different types of content.

3. **Global Persistence**: This screenshot demonstrates that once a time capsule is saved, it remains accessible regardless of distance. Even if there are differences in distance between countries, the capsules are maintained in their original locations, showcasing the global nature of the application.

## üöÄ Challenges and Solutions

<details>
<summary>AR Content Rendering Optimization</summary>
<br>
We conducted continuous testing and improvement to maintain a balance between AR content quality and performance, considering various device environments. In particular, we applied rendering optimization techniques to provide a smooth experience even on low-spec devices.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Natural Placement of AR Content</summary>
<br>
We implemented natural placement of AR content through user pose estimation, surrounding environment recognition, real-time feedback, and correction. This allows users to experience AR that blends naturally with the real world.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Location-Based Service Accuracy</summary>
<br>
We provided accurate location information using Google Maps API and device GPS, and optimized the algorithm for searching time capsules within 1km. This allows users to accurately find time capsules around their location.
</details>

<details>
<summary>User Experience Improvement</summary>
<br>
We continuously collected and analyzed user feedback to improve UI/UX and design intuitive interfaces. In particular, we implemented a user-friendly interface so that even users who are new to AR can easily use it.
